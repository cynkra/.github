# We are cynkra

[cynkra](https://cynkra.com) is a Zurich based data science company enthusiastic about open source software and the [R](https://r-project.org) ecosystem in particular. 
GitHub is home to many of our open source contributions from the [dm](https://dm.cynkra.com) and [DBI](https://dbi.r-dbi.org) R packages to [seasonal](http://www.seasonal.website) or [tibble](https://tibble.tidyverse.org). We are excited to continue to share and discuss our code!
